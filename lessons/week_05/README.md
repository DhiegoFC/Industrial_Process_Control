# First-Order and Second-Order Systems in Simulink

This lesson provides a detailed exploration of the behavior of First and Second-Order Systems in both Open and Closed Loop configurations, with a focus on systems with and without transport delays.

## First-Order Systems

Explore the fundamental characteristics of First-Order Systems, highlighting their response dynamics in both open and closed-loop settings.
