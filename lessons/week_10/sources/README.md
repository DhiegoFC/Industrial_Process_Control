# Tuning a PWM-Based PID Controller with Derivative Filter, Anti-Windup, and Setpoint Weighting Techniques on Arduino UNO

Building on the circuit from Exercise 09, this project allows you to practice implementing a PID controller on an Arduino UNO, incorporating advanced techniques such as Derivative Filtering, Anti-Windup, and Setpoint Weighting. By using the provided code, you can experiment with these features to fine-tune the controller's performance.
