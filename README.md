### Industrial Process Control
Public Repository for 'Industrial Process Control', a undergraduate course offered by the Department of Control and Automation Engineering at the State University of São Paulo (UNESP), Institute of Science and Technology, Sorocaba (ICTS).

#### Objectives
* Understand the Concept and Importance of Industrial Process Control.
* Comprehend the Dynamic Characteristics of Industrial Processes.
* Learn to Model Industrial Processes.
* Understand what PID Controllers (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) are and what they are used for.
* Learn the intrinsic characteristics of the Proportional, Integral, and Derivative actions of PID Controllers.
* Learn the techniques for tuning PID controllers.
* Apply Advanced Control Techniques in Industrial Processes (Feedforward, Cascade, Selective Control, etc.).
* Learn to simulate Industrial Processes in Python (Google Colab) and Simulink (Matlab).
* Apply Knowledge in Real Engineering Situations (depending on the available material).

#### Evaluation
Most evaluation tests will be carried out using the Simulink Software Tool (Matlab) and maybe programming in Python (Google Colab). Depending on available materials, the evaluation tests might be switched to practical experiments in the Electronics Laboratory.

#### Prerequisites
* Advanced knowledge in Calculus, especially in the Laplace transform of a function.
* Advanced knowledge in Electricity and Electronics.
* Programming skills.
